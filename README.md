# philosophers

A programm in C that represents the problem of the philosophers. The dilem is that you have many philosophers sitted around around a round table, they each 
have to eat a plate but they share the fork inbetween them and need both of them to eat. They have a specific time to eat before dying and therefore should share
their forks effectivly in order to all eat. 

The goal of this project is to design protocls that can handle accesss to shared ressources between process without causing deadlocks.
